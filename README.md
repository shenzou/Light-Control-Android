# Light-Control-Android

Trying a simple program which can connect to Yeelights locally.

## Working

- Turn on/off
- Choose RGB color
- Change brightness
- Choose between different Bulbs/rooms

## How to use it?

1. On the official yeelight app, turn on the LAN control for your bulb
2. Until new release, find the IP of you Bulb and put it in the Android code

## Future developments

- Correction of bugs (with RGB selector and offline bulbs, see the [Issues](https://github.com/shenzou/Light-Control-Android/issues) for more details.

## Libraries

I used the following libraries to do it:
- [yapi from Florian Mollin](https://github.com/florian-mollin/yapi)
- [HoloColorPicker from LarsWerkman](https://github.com/LarsWerkman/HoloColorPicker)
